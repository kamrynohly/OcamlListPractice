(* Let's learn about lists and list functions in Ocaml. *)

(* Exercise 1: Construct a pattern-matching function that takes in
a list and outputs the number of elements in the list. *)



(* Exercise 2: Research and use the List.length function to accomplish
the same as Exercise 1 without pattern-matching. *)



(* Exercise 3: Construct a function that pattern matches an integer list and 
returns the integer list with each element doubled. *)



(* Exercise 4: Research and use the List.map function to accomplish the
same as Exercise 3 without pattern-matching. *)



(* Exercise 5 (challenge): Without pattern-matching, create a function that 
filters an integer list to output only the even numbers in the list. *)
(* Hint: List.filter might be helpful here! *)
